        We're excited to introduce you to this transformative force of nature,
        Sor Maria Rosa Leggolâ€”a 93-year-old Franciscan nun and humanitarian with
        a 70+ year legacy of improving the lives of Honduras' most vulnerable.
        Con Esta Luz (With This Light) is a feature length documentary film that
        shares her story through the eyes of young people whose lives she
        forever changed.

        I will always need a lighthouse, a beacon of light, because with that
        light I can get through to people to understand them, so I can help
        them, so they can have relief. My life is, how to relieve others? How
        can I make them feel, even a little bit, that God loves them.
